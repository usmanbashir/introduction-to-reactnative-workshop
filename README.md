# Introduction To React Native: Workshop

React Native lets you build mobile apps using only JavaScript. It uses the same design as 
React, letting you compose a rich mobile UI using declarative components.

A React Native app is a real mobile app. The apps you are building with React Native 
aren't mobile web apps because React Native uses the same fundamental UI building blocks 
as regular iOS and Android apps. Instead of using Swift, Kotlin or Java, you are putting 
those building blocks together using JavaScript and React.

In this workshop, we will learn how to build a component-based mobile-app using React 
Native.

For anyone, who needs a refresher on JavaScript. I recommend you read the excellent
